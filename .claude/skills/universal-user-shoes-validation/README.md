# universal-user-shoes-validation

Validates any product surface — UI, API, CLI, agent flow, dashboard, or document — the way a real first-time user would, then renders an evidence-backed GO / NO-GO / BLOCKED decision instead of a "looks fine to me."

## Install

```bash
# claude.ai — Settings -> Capabilities -> Upload skill
# upload dist/universal-user-shoes-validation-1.0.0.skill

# Claude Code (manual, always works)
cp -r universal-user-shoes-validation ~/.claude/skills/
# or, project-scoped:
cp -r universal-user-shoes-validation .claude/skills/

# skills.sh ecosystem (once published to your own repo)
npx skills add <your-repo-url> --skill universal-user-shoes-validation
```

## Before / After

**Task**: ship a redesigned feature without quietly breaking it or flattening its design.

|                    | Without this skill                               | With this skill                                                                            |

| Validation method  | Code review — assumes correctness if it compiles | First-time-user walkthrough of the live entry point; every action proven or honestly gated |
| Quality regression | Caught after launch, if at all                   | Caught pre-merge via a mandatory before/after evidence gate                                |
| Decision artifact  | A verbal opinion                                 | A written GO / NO-GO / BLOCKED report with an evidence matrix                              |
| Domain coverage    | Whatever the reviewer happens to know            | UI, API, CLI, agent flow, dashboard, document, and process — one shared rubric             |

Package metrics below are measured, sourced from `scorecard.json` (regenerate with `python scripts/forge.py score .`):

## What it does

- Classifies any surface — UI, API, CLI, agent/chat flow, dashboard, document, or internal process — and identifies its real entry point and prerequisites before judging it.
- Tests from the same entry point a real user would use, and records whether every visible action works, is honestly gated, or fails.
- Gates quality-affecting changes behind a before/after evidence requirement so redesigns cannot quietly flatten or generify a product.
- Produces a GO / NO-GO / BLOCKED decision with a full evidence matrix, plus an implementation handoff prompt when work remains.
- Ships a script to scaffold a repeatable, domain-tagged evidence pack for any validation scope.

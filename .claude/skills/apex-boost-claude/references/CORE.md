## 1. SPARSE PRIMING REPRESENTATIONS (SPR)

**What**: Compress long context into minimal activation-sufficient tokens. Latent knowledge is already in the model — you're priming it, not restating it.

**How**:

```
INSTEAD OF: "The user is a CEO of a software company called APEX Business Systems Ltd.
             in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada who builds 14 production apps..."

SPR VERSION: "User: APEX CEO · Edmonton · 14 prod apps · $12-16M valuation · solo dev"
```

**Rules**:

- Strip articles, conjunctions, filler phrases
- Use `:` and `·` as semantic separators
- Preserve only tokens that change model behavior
- History >10 turns → SPR-compress prior turns to 1-2 bullet lines per turn

**Compression target**: 60–75% token reduction with <3% quality loss  
**Source**: Dave Shapiro + LAION community, 2023. Validated against GPT-4 and Claude 2.

## 2. CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (COT) VARIANTS

### 2a. Zero-Shot CoT

**Trigger**: Add "Let's think step by step." before reasoning-heavy answers.  
**When**: Tier 1–2 tasks without examples needed.  
**Source**: Kojima et al. 2022, Google — _Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners_.

### 2b. Few-Shot CoT

**Trigger**: Provide 2–3 worked examples before the task.  
**When**: Domain-specific reasoning where zero-shot underperforms.  
**Format**:

```
Q: [example problem]
A: Step 1: ... Step 2: ... Answer: [result]

Q: [actual problem]
A: [model completes]
```

**Source**: Wei et al. 2022, Google Brain — NeurIPS 2022.

### 2c. Least-to-Most Prompting

**Trigger**: Decompose complex task → solve subproblems sequentially → compose.  
**When**: Tier 2–3 tasks with clear dependency chains.  
**Format**:

```
Sub-problems: [list in dependency order]
Solve P1 → use answer in P2 → ... → final answer
```

**Source**: Zhou et al. 2022, Google Brain.

## 3. TREE OF THOUGHTS (TOT)

**What**: Deliberate problem solving via tree search. Explore multiple reasoning branches, evaluate, prune, select best.

**When**: Tier 3–4. Ambiguous architecture decisions. Novel problems with no clear path.

**Protocol**:

```
1. Decompose into thought steps T1, T2, ... Tn
2. At each step: generate 2–3 candidate continuations
3. Evaluate each: [feasible / partial / infeasible]
4. Select best continuation → continue tree
5. Backtrack if dead end
6. Output winning path
```

**Breadth-First (BFS)** → use when breadth of options matters most  
**Depth-First (DFS)** → use when committed exploration of one path is faster

**Source**: Yao et al. 2023, Princeton + Google DeepMind — _Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LLMs_.

---

## 4. SELF-CONSISTENCY

**What**: Sample multiple reasoning paths independently → majority-vote the answer.

**When**: Tier 4. High-stakes factual claims. Math/logic where drift risk is high.

**Protocol**:

```
Generate Path A → conclusion CA
Generate Path B → conclusion CB
Generate Path C → conclusion CC
If CA == CB == CC → ship with confidence
If split → examine minority path → resolve or flag uncertainty
```

**Source**: Wang et al. 2022, Google Brain — _Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning_.

---

## 5. REACT (REASON + ACT)

**What**: Interleave reasoning traces with actions (tool calls). Reason about what to do → do it → observe result → reason next step.

**When**: Any task requiring tool use (web search, bash, file ops, APIs).

**Format**:

```
Thought: I need to find the current version of X.
Action: web_search("X current version 2026")
Observation: [results]
Thought: Results show version 4.2. Now I need to check compatibility.
Action: bash_tool("cat package.json | grep X")
...
Final Answer: [synthesized from observations]
```

## 6. SKELETON-OF-THOUGHT (SOT)

**What**: Generate output skeleton (outline) first → fill sections in parallel → merge. Dramatically reduces latency for long outputs.

**When**: Any output >500 tokens that has parallelizable sections.

**Protocol**:

```
1. Generate skeleton: "[Section 1 title]: ... [Section 2 title]: ... [Section N title]: ..."
2. For each section: generate content independently (no cross-dependencies)
3. Merge in order
4. Apply TCE compression pass
```

**Parallelizable**: Independent sections (features list, comparison table, multiple code modules)  
**Non-parallelizable**: Sequential reasoning, narrative, argument that builds on prior sections

## 7. CONSTITUTIONAL AI (CAI) SELF-CRITIQUE

**What**: Model critiques its own output against a constitution of principles → revises.

**When**: Runs in Constitutional Verify Gate (SKILL.md Section VI) on every output.

**Constitution for apex-boost**:

```
Principle 1: Output is truthful — every claim backed by evidence or labeled as inference.
Principle 2: Output is complete — no deferred logic, no TODOs, no placeholders.
Principle 3: Output is compressed — no filler, no repetition, no hedges.
Principle 4: Output matches stated goal — not adjacent to it, EXACTLY it.
Principle 5: Output is actionable — recipient can act without clarification.
```

**Self-critique format**:

```
[Generate output]
Critique: Does output violate any principle? List violations.
Revision: Fix each violation → regenerate.
Gate: All principles satisfied? YES → ship. NO → repeat.
```

## 8. PROMPT COMPRESSION (LLMLingua-Style)

**What**: Compress verbose prompts by removing low-perplexity (predictable) tokens while preserving high-perplexity (information-dense) tokens.

**Rules**:

- Articles → often removable (the, a, an)
- Conjunctions → compress to punctuation where possible
- Redundant context → remove if model already knows it
- Examples → keep if they change model behavior; cut if illustrative only
- Instructions → keep command verbs; cut surrounding prose

**Compression targets by use case**:
| Content Type | Target Compression | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Background context | 60–70% | Low |
| Instruction blocks | 20–30% | Med |
| Few-shot examples | 30–40% | Med |
| Code snippets | 0–10% | High |

## 9. SELF-REFINE

**What**: Iterative self-improvement. Generate → critique → refine → repeat until convergence.

**When**: First-pass output fails Constitutional Verify Gate.

**Protocol**:

```
Output V1 → [Constitutional Verify Gate]
FAIL → Critique: "What is wrong? Be specific."
     → Refine: Apply fix to each identified flaw
     → Output V2 → [Gate again]
Max iterations: 2 (if V3 still fails → flag for human review)
```

**Convergence signal**: No new violations found in critique pass.

## 10. GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY 2.0 COMPONENTS

### 10a. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Routing

**What**: Route each task token/segment to the most relevant expert sub-model. Only N of M experts activate per token. Reduces effective compute per forward pass.

**apex-boost implementation**: Antigravity Routing Engine (SKILL.md Section III) — conceptually mirrors MoE by activating only the relevant expert module (FORGE, MIND, SIGNAL, etc.) without loading unused context.

**Source**: Gemini 1.5 Technical Report, Google DeepMind, 2024.

### 10b. Long-Context Grounding

**What**: Ground answers in retrieved long-context evidence rather than parametric memory.

**apex-boost implementation**: When context >50K tokens exists — retrieve only the relevant chunk via SPR anchors, not full context.

**Source**: Gemini 1.5 Pro 1M-token context — Google DeepMind 2024.

### 10c. AlphaCode 2 Sampling Strategy

**What**: Generate N candidate solutions → filter by correctness criteria → select best.

**apex-boost implementation**: For code generation, generate 2–3 implementations → evaluate against test criteria → output winning implementation only.

**Source**: AlphaCode 2, DeepMind 2023.

### 10d. Test-Time Compute Scaling

**What**: Allocate more inference compute to harder problems at test time rather than uniformly.

**apex-boost implementation**: IAS tier selection dynamically allocates reasoning depth based on detected task complexity. Trivial tasks get Tier 0 (minimal compute). Critical tasks get Tier 4 (maximum reasoning).

**Source**: Snell et al. 2024, Google DeepMind — _Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally_.

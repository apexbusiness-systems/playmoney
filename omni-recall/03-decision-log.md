### 2026-06-14 · D-001 · omni-recall created
Created this folder to bake durable state in from the start (no prior session memory; no
omni-recall existed at recon). Source-of-truth = repo; target = Rev.3 spec (`01-compliance-map.md`).

### 2026-06-14 · D-002 · Avenue taxonomy mismatch (OPEN)
`RecoveryAvenue` in `src/lib/playmoney/types.ts` enumerates *problem types*
(refund | fee_reversal | subscription | billing_error | double_charge), NOT the "4
administrative avenues" of Control #9. M7 (avenue registry) must reconcile: define the 4
administrative avenues explicitly and hard-DISABLE insurance/credit/DTC/US at registry level.
Do not conflate problem-type with avenue. **Open until M7.**

### 2026-06-14 · STOP-001 (RAISED then PARTIALLY LIFTED) · No backend → Supabase provisioned
- RAISED: Recon found a frontend-only mock prototype (no DB/Supabase/RLS/test runner).
  Rev.3 premise that #1/#4/#5/#7/#15/#16 scaffold "already exists" was false → ABORT #4 fired.
  Held off blind-building the 7 Supabase modules.
- UPDATE (06:13Z): User provisioned a Supabase instance. Env vars present (NAMES only):
  `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_TOKEN`. Backend now exists → the "no backend" basis of STOP-001 is lifted.
- STILL OPEN: existing controls #4/#7/#15 remain MISSING in code; must be BUILT (not "verified
  existing"). Verify the Supabase project's current schema before building (it may be empty).
- STILL OPEN (external, not code): G-counsel, G-insurance remain ops/legal gates.

### 2026-06-14 · D-003 · YELLOW assumptions registered (proceed; revisit if repo dictates)
- Aggregator: default **Flinks** (Canada-first) for `AccountDataPort` (read-only, OAuth, no
  creds, no payment-init). Plaid acceptable alternative. Revisit when adapter is wired.
- PSP: default **Stripe** as merchant-of-record for fee-only `PayoutPort`. No wallet/stored-value.
- Fee: default **25%**, configurable, within the 20–30% benchmark band (#13).
- Test runner: none installed → will add **Vitest** (dev-only) to satisfy §5 "show the run".
  Pending confirmation; flagged because it adds a dependency to a Lovable scaffold.

### 2026-06-14 · INVARIANT REMINDER
App default mode = BUILT. `canGoLive()` must return false until all gates green. No code path,
flag, seed, or test may set LIVE. Secrets only via env; never in code or this folder.
